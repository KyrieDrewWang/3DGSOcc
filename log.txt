sem_loss_rendered averaged among view poitns
sem_loss_rendered calculated with mask (generating when projecting sem labels)
learning rate = 1e-4
weight 2.0 to the loss_lss_depth
======v1.6
git commit id 5b3a6f054e1e6bc476ab3b89316049f94555ff18
based on 1.5
the opacity is generated using opacity head
======v1.7
git commit id
based on 1.6
the sem_loss_rendered are not averaged on viewpoints
======v1.8
git commit id f187d2edfb576fc63ef185a63778c87e32b2c241
based on 1.7
auxilary frames are used [-1,1,2]
======v1.9
git commit id ea405d088f9c4833ea4981ec32e43538d9ca116f
based on 1.4
auxilary frames are used [-1,1,2]
the other parameters of the splatting reandering are set require_grad=True
======v2.0
git commit id 163504bca52dffd4251a58e41a6d18ee2dea39aa
based on 1.4
auxilary frames are used [-2, -1, 1, 1, 2]
the semantic rendering maps are supervised by SAM emddings (256, 64,64) after going through the MLP layer to adjust the channels.
======v2.1
git commit id 
baed on 2.0
auxilary frames are used [-2, 2]
the rendered image shapes are changed to [225, 400] and the SAM embddings are interpolated to the same size.
